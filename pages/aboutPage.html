                    Buying a brand new phone can often feel like a significant investment, with the latest models
                    commanding high prices. However, opting for a quality, gently used device from OnlyPhones allows
                    you to enjoy all the features you need at a fraction of the cost. By choosing pre-owned phones,
                    you can potentially save hundreds of dollars compared to purchasing new.

                <p class="about-text">
                    The environmental impact of electronic waste, or e-waste, is a growing concern worldwide.
                    Did you know that over 80% of phones generally end up in landfills? This contributes to pollution,
                    resource depletion, and various environmental hazards. By extending the lifespan of phones through
                    reuse and recycling, we can significantly reduce e-waste and its harmful effects on the planet.
